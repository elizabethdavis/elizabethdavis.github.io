<h1>Design Leadership at WEX</h1>
<h2>My Journey at WEX: 5+ Years of Growth and Innovation in Product Design</h2>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
  <p>Since joining WEX in 2019, my career in product design has been defined by growth, innovation, and impactful contributions in benefits software. I’ve had the privilege of shaping digital experiences that impact over 20 million benefit account users. This journey has been more than a collection of projects—it’s been a continual evolution, marked by key achievements and valuable lessons learned along the way.</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Career Progression</b></h3>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-12">
		<div class="timeline-item">
			<h5>2019: Embarking on the WEX Journey</h5>
			<p>I started at WEX as an Individual Contributor, eager to apply my UX skills to the complex world of benefits software. From day one, I was immersed in challenging projects that pushed me to grow both creatively and technically. I was responsible for the redesign of 1 portal and started working on feature updates in another portal.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="col-12">
		<div class="timeline-item">
			<h5>2020: Rising to Leadership</h5>
			<p>After just a year and a half, my dedication and innovative approach to UX design were recognized with a promotion to a leadership position. This new role allowed me to not only continue hands-on design work but also to guide and inspire my small but mighty team of 2 as we managed design work across 3 platforms on web and mobile applications.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="col-12">
		<div class="timeline-item">
			<h5>2022: Growing My Team</h5>
			<p>After increased demand for UX design partnership across the organization, our team has continued to grow. Through a company acquisition of Benefit Administration software and a design team reorg, we restructured our design team to help manage the workload. As a result, my team grew to 4 direct reports within Benefits and grew to manage 5 benefit portals.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="col-12">
		<div class="timeline-item">
			<h5>Today: Leading a Dynamic Design Team and Benefits Design Strategy</h5>
			<p>Presently, I manage a team of 5 talented UX professionals. Together, we tackle 20-25 efforts annually ranging from large scale redesigns to smaller efforts, driving innovation and user-centric design in benefits software solutions. Our work impacts millions of users, simplifying complex processes and enhancing the overall experience of managing benefits across 5 portals on web and mobile platforms.</p>

      <h4>2019</h4>

        <p>"Elizabeth, who joined us in August, is another key addition to our young and growing team. <b>She was an immediate asset on the Health business</b>, applying her agency background to quickly ground herself in current projects while also focusing on understanding the business at large. I am excited about the design potential she brings to the team." <br>- Chris D.</p>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h4>2020</h4>
        <p>"<b>Elizabeth is a role model within the team for both task management and design file organization</b>. She always brings a friendly and supportive attitude to every new challenge and instills confidence in her stakeholders. Known to be reliable and committed to her tasks, delivering quality work on time. Her UX work in all three portals; Employer, Consumer and Administrator has been outstanding and her efforts have won over the trust and enthusiasm of her development partners. A big win! Elizabeth stays true to our UX process and her partnership with our UX Research colleagues on the HSA Contribution Optimizer project is resulting in a highly intuitive, user friendly tool for our Consumer Portal."<br>-Chris D.</p>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h4>2021</h4>
        <p>"All of Elizabeth's partners rave about her work and attitude. She is a pleasure to work with (that’s coming from both your design team and external partners). <b>She's a creative talent, organizational whiz, and a key member of our UX team!</b><br>-Drew K.</p>

        <p>"Elizabeth has made great strides in shifting her role. She is leaning into, and influencing, strategy and as a result becoming a valued contributor to the Line of Business. This is demonstrated by her inclusion in key conversations and her deep understanding of the Benefits space, key players and priorities. <b>Her team models collaboration. The team is tight, organized and actively promotes a culture of rapid prototyping and experimentation. Her focus on organization pays big dividends for the ability of her team to deliver with time for ideation.</b>"<br>- Eulah S.</p>

  <h3><b>Looking Ahead</b></h3>
  <p>As I reflect on these five years at WEX, I'm incredibly proud of what I have accomplished professionally, and excited about the team I have helped build. The world of benefits software is constantly evolving, providing new challenges and opportunities in UX design. I'm committed to continuing this journey of innovation, always striving to create digital experiences that are not just functional, but truly transformative for our users.</p>
