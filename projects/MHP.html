			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>WEX Health developed My HSA Planner, an AI-powered tool designed to help consumers determine optimal contribution levels for their Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Developed in partnership with Picwell, the tool provides personalized recommendations using data such as age, health conditions, and financial goals, helping users make informed decisions about their HSA contributions and long-term healthcare savings. The tool is available in two versions: a standalone version that can be accessed publicly by partners and employers for any employee population, and an integrated version within the WEX Consumer portal. The integrated version offers a post-login, pre-populated experience that leverages existing participant data to simplify decision-making and maximize contributions. Both versions will be available during open enrollment to support current and prospective HSA account holders. My HSA Planner is fully responsive, ensuring an optimized experience across all device types.
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>Consumers often lack the guidance needed to set the optimal contribution amount for their HSAs, leading to underfunding, missed tax advantages, and financial unpreparedness for future medical expenses. Existing tools generally offer limited, static guidance, whereas My HSA Planner aims to fill this gap by providing a highly personalized, AI-driven recommendation.</p><br>
				<h3>Business Context</h3>
				<p>By helping consumers maximize their HSA contributions, My HSA Planner supports increased HSA deposits, which benefits WEX Health and its partners financially. For employers, this tool represents a strategic asset to improve employee engagement with health benefits and enables data-driven insights into tool usage and its impact on HSA enrollment and contributions.</p><br>
				<h3>User Needs</h3>
				<p>For consumers, My HSA Planner meets the need for a clear, actionable understanding of how their HSA can contribute to long-term financial health, covering aspects like tax savings, out-of-pocket costs, and retirement readiness. By offering a recommended contribution level based on individual factors, the tool provides confidence in financial decisions and encourages informed planning for healthcare expenses.</p><br>

		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<p>User experience designer | User interface designer | Interaction designer | Product designer<br>
			<p>As the lead designer, I directed the design strategy to ensure the experience was approachable and reassuring, aligning with the financial planning context. With support from one additional designer, I collaborated closely with the product manager and tech team to integrate product and technical requirements. We aimed to step away from traditional WEX branding to create a user-centered, comforting experience tailored for a hybrid target persona of younger HSA users.</p>

	<!-- Process Breakdown -->
	<h1>The Process</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<h2>Discovery</h2>
			<h4>Research-Based Approach</h4>
			<p>The discovery phase centered around a research-driven approach to ensure the final design would resonate with users and meet their needs. Our approach included several key activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Moodboards: We created moodboards to explore visual directions and design aesthetics, testing for a warm, friendly, welcoming, and familiar tone. The goal was to emphasize the core message of saving while creating an approachable experience for users.</li>
				<li>Usability Testing: We conducted usability tests to ensure the tool’s flow was intuitive. The focus was on minimizing friction by reducing unnecessary questions and identifying any pain points in the process. We also observed how users interacted with the recommendations to ensure they were actionable and easy to understand.</li>
				<li>Focus Groups: We held focus groups with voluntary participants to gather qualitative feedback on early concepts and prototypes. These participants were given a first look at the tool to understand how they would interact with it, providing valuable insights into user preferences and expectations. This helped us validate design choices and refine the user experience.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>User Personas and Journey Maps</h4>
			<p>From a library of 14 user personas across three major groups—consumers, employers, and admins—we focused specifically on the key consumer personas for this project. These personas represented different user segments, helping us tailor the experience to the needs of younger HSA holders, who were a primary target for the tool. In addition, we developed journey maps to visualize critical touchpoints and opportunities to guide users through the tool’s features and benefits, ensuring the design addressed their most pressing needs.</p>

			<h4>Stakeholder Collaboration</h4>
			<p>In parallel with user research, we worked closely with product management, technical teams, and our third-party partner, Picwell, to align on the tool’s goals and technical requirements. These discussions emphasized the importance of integrating AI-powered personalization and providing tailored recommendations to users based on their unique financial and health profiles.</p>

			<h2>Ideation and Strategy</h2>
			<h4>Concept Development</h4>
			<p>We began the ideation phase by exploring visual directions through moodboards, setting the creative tone for My HSA Planner. The goal was to establish a friendly, approachable, and comforting aesthetic for a financial planning tool, making it more inviting for users. Once the mood and style were established, we moved into wireframing, developing early concepts that would serve as a basis for collaboration with Picwell and usability testing.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Wireframes and Usability Testing</h4>
			<p>Wireframes were shared with Picwell to ensure technical feasibility and to validate the AI-driven logic and data requirements. Usability testing was conducted with real users to measure how efficiently they could complete tasks, identify pain points, and ensure that the information being collected was comprehensive and accurate enough to feed into the AI engine. This helped refine the questions we asked, as we wanted to keep the process streamlined without compromising the accuracy of the AI’s recommendations.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Design Direction & Key Features</h4>
			<p>Several key features set My HSA Planner apart from other tools in the market:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Leveraging Picwell’s API for Accuracy: We asked fewer questions to gather more accurate data, relying on Picwell’s extensive claims data and machine learning algorithms to enhance the quality of the recommendations.</li>
				<li>AI-Driven Personalization: The tool uses AI to analyze claims data from millions of people across the country, identifying individuals who are most similar to the user. This "people like you" approach allows the tool to predict the user’s health care utilization more accurately, factoring in their personal preferences such as their tendency to be a saver or spender, and their financial risk tolerance.</li>
				<li>Engaging, Non-Linear Flow: Rather than presenting users with a traditional form, My HSA Planner uses a "Mad Libs" style approach. It breaks down the information into small, digestible pieces, paired with engaging messaging that guides the user through the process. This approach was tested and well received for its ease of use and its clarity in communicating what information was needed.</li>
				<li>Contextual Support: To ensure users understood the information being requested, we included helpful interstitials, pop-ups, and “what you’ll need” messaging. Feedback from usability testing confirmed that these additional features were valuable in guiding users through the process.</li>
				<li>Inclusive Design: The tool was designed with inclusivity in mind, ensuring that it wasn’t just about maximizing HSA contributions but about meeting users where they are. This inclusive design ensured that users of varying financial literacy levels could engage with the tool effectively.</li>
				<li>Data-Driven Customization: The AI not only personalizes recommendations based on user data but also factors in broader patterns from similar individuals, making the experience both highly personalized and deeply informed by data.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h2>Design Execution</h2>
			<h4>Simplifying the User Experience</h4>
			<p>Our design execution focused on making the process of entering information as simple and intuitive as possible. By reducing the number of questions asked and providing clear messaging throughout, we aimed to minimize cognitive load while ensuring the tool’s effectiveness. We also tested the time it took users to complete the tool and gathered feedback on whether they felt they would have dropped off earlier in the process. This helped us gauge both user engagement and tool efficiency.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Interactive Prototypes</h4>
			<p>We created interactive prototypes in Figma for both web and mobile responsive versions. These prototypes were tested to ensure the tool was easy to navigate and functional across different screen sizes. We focused on four breakpoints for screen sizes: web, small web, tablet, and mobile. Testing allowed us to validate the interactivity of the tool and optimize the experience for various devices. Feedback from users confirmed that the tool was easy to use, no matter the device.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Collaboration & Handoff</h4>
			<p>As the lead designer, I collaborated closely with our development team, using Figma to create final deliverables. We used an early version of Dev Mode to ensure the development team had access to accurate specs and design details. This streamlined the handoff process and allowed for smoother implementation of the final design.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Key Findings & User Feedback</h4>
			<p>Through usability testing and user feedback, we gathered key insights into how the tool performed and how users felt about the experience:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Ease of Use: Users consistently described the tool as easy to use on both web and mobile, with the process being quicker than expected.</li>
				<li>Personalized Recommendations: Users felt there was enough information on the personalized recommendations page to help guide their HSA decisions. The inclusion of educational content was particularly appreciated, as it helped build trust in the system.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<h4>Direct Quotes from Users</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>"I wish my employer had something that easy for recommending HSA contributions…really, really well done."</li>
					<li>"This was fun to do…going through the whole thing was really easy."</li>
					<li>[on educational content] "It explains why they’re asking the questions and I think that’s super helpful and also gives me some trust in the system that I’m not just providing all this information for no reason."</li>
