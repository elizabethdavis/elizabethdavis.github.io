			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>I was assigned to a project that initially tried to build a tool for users without doing proper research, user testing, and user experience design first. While the software had over 1.4 million users out of necessity for the service, the users couldn't properly use the tool. As a result, the call centers started to get overwhelmed with help calls, users became frustrated, and the tool was deemed unusable. That's when my team was brought in.<br><br><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190115005246/en/CAQH-Develops-Provider-Data-Management-Solution-Delegated" target="_blank">Check out this review by Business Wire on the impact it has had in the industry!</a></p>

	<!-- Objectives -->
	<h1>The Goal</h1>
	<p>Our job was to develop a design system that had four basic qualities:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-3" align="center">
			<img src="../projects/caqh-files/navigate.png" class="icons">
			<h3>Self-Guided<br><br></h3><p><i>Users should be able to navigate the tool on their own without engaging support</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" align="center">
			<img src="../projects/caqh-files/simple.png" class="icons">
			<h3>Simple<br><br></h3><p><i>Allow users to focus on a single task at a time</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" align="center">
			<img src="../projects/caqh-files/forward.png" class="icons">
			<h3>Forward Thinking<br><br></h3><p><i>Develop a responsive design that could be reused and effective in additional projects</i></p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-3" align="center">
			<img src="../projects/caqh-files/accessible.png" class="icons">
			<h3>Accessible<br><br></h3><p><i>All elements should pass WCAG 2.0 AA standards</i></p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<p>This project consisted of four different portals - provider groups, health plans, credentialing, and operations support - so it had to be able to cover a variety of components while staying true to the design system. Our objective was to develop a system that would improve the overall experience of maintaining provider group, retrieving provider data, making the credentialing process for providers easier, and providing operations staff with a tool that will reduce support calls.</p><br>

	</div>

	<!-- Project Responsibilities -->
	<h1>My Role</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<p>I was initially sent out on this project as a user experience designer, responsible for developing the journey maps, wireframes, and prototypes for the project. As different portals were added on, I was given additional responsibilities as other team members rolled off, eventually managing the user experience, visual design, and design system for all projects. Though it was a heavy leadership role, I had a great team to work with and learned a lot along the way.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>User experience designer</li>
				<li>User interface designer</li>
				<li>Interaction designer</li>
				<li>Product designer</li>
			</ul>

				<th scope="row">User Experience Design</th>
				<td>Developed and managed all sketch resources, which had <b>over 300 screens</b> by the end of the project. I saw the design process from the initial research findings through sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and the live product.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">User Interface Design</th>
				<td>Developed <b>new visual design guidelines</b> that would be reused across all portals in future redesigns. These design decisions were documented in a comprehensive, <b>20+ page document</b> and a <b>well-organized sketch file</b> that was handed off to the on-site designer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Interaction Design</th>
				<td>Created <b>8 interactive Invision prototypes</b> used by a variety of teams to show the users and stakeholders on the project. These prototypes were also used to show the developers what the end design and interaction would be like.</td>

			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Product Design</th>
				<td>Responsible for <b>maintaining a comprehensive overview</b> of the product that could be handed off to business analysts, developers, and stakeholders.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Team Leader</th>
				<td>Communicate design decisions and business requirements to the development teams. <b>Lead design thinking workshops</b> that explained the <b>latest trends in design</b> and suggested improvements to the tool based on this research.</td>
