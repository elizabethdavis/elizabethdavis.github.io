	<h3>UX Project: Complex Data Applications at CAQH</h3>
	<h3>Company: Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH)</h3>
	<h3>Location: Washington, DC</h3>
	<h3>Duration: December 2017 - October 2018</h3><br>

	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>I was assigned to a project that initially tried to build a tool for users without doing proper research, user testing, and user experience design first. While the software had over 1.4 million users out of necessity for the service, the users couldn't properly use the tool. As a result, the call centers started to get overwhelmed with help calls, users became frustrated, and the tool was deemed unusable. That's when my team was brought in.</p><br>

	<h1>The Goal</h1>
	<p>Our job was to develop a design system that had four basic qualities:</p>
	<ul><b>Self-Guided:</b> Users should be able to navigate the tool on their own without engaging support</ul>
	<ul><b>Simple:</b> Allow users to focus on a single task at a time</ul>
	<ul><b>Forward Thinking:</b> Develop a responsive design that could be reused and effective in additional projects</ul>
	<ul><b>Accessible:</b> All elements should pass WCAG 2.0 AA standards</ul>
	<p>This project consisted of four different portals - provider groups, health plans, credentialing, and operations support - so it had to be able to cover a variety of components while staying true to the design system. Our objective was to develop a system that would improve the overall experience of maintaining provider group, retrieving provider data, making the credentialing process for providers easier, and providing operations staff with a tool that will reduce support calls.</p><br>

	<h1>My Role</h1>
	<p>I was initially sent out on this project as a user experience designer, responsible for developing the journey maps, wireframes, and prototypes for the project. As different portals were added on, I was given additional responsibilities as other team members rolled off, eventually managing the user experience, visual design, and design system for all projects. Though it was a heavy leadership role, I had a great team to work with and learned a lot along the way.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>User experience designer</li>
		<li>User interface designer</li>
		<li>Interaction designer</li>
		<li>Product designer</li>
	</ul>

				<th scope="row">Interaction Design</th>
				<td>Created 8 interactive Invision prototypes used by a variety of teams to show the users and stakeholders on the project. These prototypes were also used to show the developers what the end design and interaction would be like.</td>

				<td>Responsible for maintaining a comprehensive overview of the product that could be handed off to business analysts, developers, and stakeholders.</td>

				<th scope="row">Team Leader</th>
				<td>Communicate design decisions and business requirements to the development teams. Lead design thinking workshops that explained the latest trends in design and suggested improvements to the tool based on this research.</td>

	<h1>Outcome</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>1.4 million users</li>
		<li>300+ screens created and tested</li>
		<li>900+ participating hospitals</li>
		<li>1 new product solution to standardize the way we manage data in healthcare</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The project launched with great success in the market. Originally used out of necessity, this project became a staple when managing data for providers in healthcare that users have found to be profoundly helpful in their daily tasks.</p><br>
