	<h3>Project: Act III</h3>
	<h3>Personal UX Project</h3><br>
	<p>This is an independent ideation project that I created to develop a more cohesive way to explore Broadway. I used this as an opportunity to explore UX wireframing applications and design thinking processes with a topic that I am passionate about.<i> This is still a work in progress, stay tuned as this project continues to grow!</i><br><br>To see a few live screen shots in action, <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F5KCSW6S7KR#/screens/301071398" target="_blank">click this link!</a></p><br>

	<h1>Overview</h1>
		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
			<p>Broadway is known for its bright lights in the middle of times square, its toe-tapping dance numbers, and ballads that will give you goosebumps. However, one thing that it is lacking is a single, go-to structure for news, events, and videos. Looking around at the different applications and websites currently available for getting information about Broadway, it can be slightly chaotic. There are a variety of problems that include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unorganized dashboards and news sources</li>
				<li>Multiple different sources to get information</li>
				<li>Outdated websites that aren't using current design standards</li>
				<li>Very few mobile applications</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a huge fan of Broadway, it has taken me some time to figure out how to get all of the information that I need to learn about its history, upcoming shows, following my favorite actors/actresses, and gathering bits and pieces of news and videos on multiple sources.</p><br>
			<p>The goal of this project was to develop an <i>all-in-one application</i> that brings everything Broadway into a single mobile application!</p>

		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<p>It is easy to get overwhelmed with a bunch of cool features for a new application. I realize that most of these aren't realistic for a single person to develop in an application, but my dream list for this app would include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Video Player</li>
			<li>Buy, sell, and present e-tickets</li>
			<li>Shop merchandise</li>
			<li>Enter lotteries</li>
			<li>'On this day' history</li>
			<li>Show Archive</li>
			<li>Awards Archive</li>
			<li>View upcoming events</li>
			<li>Community message board</li>
			<li>News</li>
			<li>Soundtracks Player</li>
			<li>...and more!</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Ultimate Goals</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a solution to connect theatre fans across the globe</li>
			<li>Become a resource for information and news within the community</li>
			<li>Make theatre more accessible</li>
			<li>Practice my design skills and learn new software for wireframing and prototyping</li>
		</ul>

	<h1>The Process</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The first step in my process of creating this application was to examine what I would like to see in an app for Broadway. Everyday, I am constantly keeping up with the news, videos, and updates within the Broadway community, and thinking about what I would like to see from an application was the best place to start. I also took inspiration from previously existing applications. These include Playbill.com, Broadway World, Broadway.com, Theatre Mania, and TKTS.</p>

		<p>After I started to figure out what information was available from each of these sites, I started to build an information architecture of what I would like this application to include.</p>

		<h2>Sketches</h2>
			<p>I developed these sketches to start to put my ideas to work. Each page has several different options for what each screen could look like. I used these low fidelity mockups to play with different design techniques for displaying data based on current design strategies for e-commerce, news, events, and information. This method is cost-effective and quick, allowing me to address the pros and cons of different designs.</p>

			<p>I broke down the application into five pages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>News</li>
				<li>Events</li>
				<li>Community</li>
				<li>Merchandise</li>
				<li>Show Information</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>After sketching my ideas for possible solutions, I started to make some inital wireframes in sketch</p>
