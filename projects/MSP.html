	<h3><b>UX Project:</b> Mission Slim-Possible!</h3>
	<h3>The College of New Jersey</h3>

	<h3><b>Duration:</b> January 2016 - May 2016</h3><br>

	<h1>Overview</h1>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>The community of Trenton is in what is known as a "food desert." This means that there are limited options available to maintain a healthy lifestyle filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. As a result, the people who live in these areas are not as healthy and may suffer from serious health complications later in life. Children who live in these areas are especially susceptible to childhood type 2 diabetes, and parents do no know how to recognize the early warning signs. Parents are also unaware of the healthy alternatives that can help their children form good eating habits.<br>Our goal is to promote a healthy lifestyle for children at the Columbus Elementary School through interactive games and exercises, while providing a mobile application to educate parents on health conscious recipes and information. Half our team will be working on an educational mobile application that specifically targets the parents of the elementary school children. In order to teach young kids about healhty eating and exercise, the other half of our team worked on creating an Amazon Alexa skill and a chatbot that will provide the children with fun food facts and simple exercise suggestions.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Recipe Generator: Create easy recipes by combining what you already have in the house</li>
		<li>Mobile Application for Parents: More informative to help educate on the bene</li>
		<li>Amazon Alexa Skill: Games for kids that get them learning and moving</li>
		<li>Chatbot: Use an environment that kids are familiar with to talk about healthy habits</li>
	</ul><br>

	<h1>Target Audience</h1>
	<p>For this project, our team seeks to create informational systems and applications that target the children and parents of the Columbus Elementary School in Trenton, NJ. According to the school nurse, Denise Van Mater, the children at the Columbus Elementary School are not interested in eating
	healthy. We plan to develop separate applications to target these two different groups. For the kids, a chatbot and an Amazon Alexa skill, and for the parents, a mobile application.</p>

	<ul><i>Our goal is to educate everyone about the importance of health and fitness, as well as the dangers of diabetes. We need to encourage kids, their parents, and the educators of the community on understanding a healthy lifestyle and the programs that they need during and after school hours.</i></ul>

	<p>Our team conducted an interview with the school nurse and identified the following problems and needs for this community.</p>

	<table class="table table-hover">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Problems</th>
				<th scope="col">Needs</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Health and fitness do not play a big role in the school or at home</td>
				<td>Understandable context - clear, concise, and informative</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Children show little interest in healthy foods</td>
				<td>Make the information fun, simple, and easy-to-use</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Because of the school's unconventional elective system, the students are limited to about one week of gym class per month</td>
				<td>Incorporate healthy lifestyles in daily schedules</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Most people in Trenton do not have access to fresh, healthy foods or outdoor recreational spaces so that they can lead healthy lifestyles</td>
				<td>Make the applications accessible after school hours, and incorporate tools that are accessible to lower income families with limited technology</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Many parents are bilingual and have trouble speaking English</td>
				<td>Condense information that is hard to understand in a way that is easy to comprehend</td>
			</tr>

	<h1>Timeline</h1>
	<p>Our team had about eight weeks to complete our project. We split up each week by the milestones we wanted to achieve from each part of our delivery - the mobile application, Alexa skill, and chatbot application. <i>(click on the image to enlarge it)</i></p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>We learned a lot about how there are certain places that do not have access to the foods that we have had growing up. This absence of proper knowledge and nutrition can create long term habits that are both unhealthy and hard to break. I believe that we successfully went through the process of developer with a specific set of users in mind, and helped us get our foot in the door of user experience and design thinking. We conducted interviews with adults close to the situation that helped us gain better insight and empathy to the problem that was presented to us. We defined the needs of the users within the community and developed ideas on how we were going to fix these needs. And we developed flow charts and system personas to represent the mockups that we needed to define the details. While we were unable to produce and handoff the final version of our project, we created a new way to learn about healthy habits that will hopefully be implemented in the future.</p>

	<h2>Next Steps</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct user testing with kids from Columbus Elementary School. (Do they like the applications, what would they change, what questions do they have, etc.)</li>
		<li>Iterate through the development of the project.</li>
		<li>Further develop the chatbot for error handling.</li>
		<li>Try to get Amazon Alexa inside the classroom.</li>
		<li>Publish the parent health application on the Android Application Store.
</li>
</ul><br>
