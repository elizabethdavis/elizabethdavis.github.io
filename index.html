		<p class="center">Hello! My name is Elizabeth Davis and I am a user experience designer currently based in NYC. I have two degrees from The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) – a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Interactive Multimedia – and my job is the perfect combination of both. As a designer with both a technical and creative background, I am uniquely positioned to effectively communicate my designs between designers and development teams. I know that diving into pixel perfect designs are just as important as analyzing the big picture, and I am always looking for an opportunity to learn something new.<br><br>I love to solve complex problems and use my imagination and creativity to make the world around me better. I have a bright, creative mind with a passion for learning and innovation. I love to take inspiration from being outside, whether it is at the beach or on a hike. I have a little over three years of experience in the field and have been loving every minute of it. My greatest strengths include learning new techniques quickly, adapting on-the-go in an agile environment, and bringing my own set of fresh ideas. Let’s change the world!</p>

	<div class="mySlides">
	  <q>Elizabeth went beyond expectations. As an analyst, I wasn't prepared for how well she handles client interactions and how fast she would grow with her role. It's been exciting working with her. She is calm in her approach to UX and looking for the deeper challenges in the client ask. In client meetings, she answers client questions and and asks great questions herself. She's shown an aptitude for Visual Design as well, taking the initial design elements and using them to build pages and expand the system.</q>
	  <p class="author">- Wally Hitchcock, Creative Director</p>
	</div>

	<div class="mySlides">
	  <q>Elizabeth does an excellent job at interacting with the client to effectively address their business needs through her designs. She is able to quickly adjust designs based on feedback from the client and developers. She's thorough in providing instructions, and guiding developers through wireframes so functionality and styling can be executed comfortably. Elizabeth is a very skilled designer, and I learned a great deal about the UX process while working alongside her on our project. She's been available to answer questions at any time, which made my task as a developer a lot easier.</q>
	  <p class="author">- Christine Gillis, Developer</p>
	</div>

	<div class="mySlides">
	  <q>Elizabeth is a well-organized designer who is able to work independently, has good observational skills and is able to present her observations and recommendations in a clear, concise way. As the only designer on the team, she was able to work independently and was productive right away with very little oversight. She was also able to synthesize her observations across multiple applications and present them in a clear way to the stakeholders.</q>
	  <p class="author">- David Young, Project Lead</p>
	</div>

	<div class="mySlides">
	  <q>I am extremely impressed with how quickly Elizabeth has taken to her project assignments. It's extremely difficult to jump into consulting right after college and she has taken to it like a duck to water. She's been placed in roles where she has taken large responsibilities and has routinely delivered exceptional work that has impressed senior leadership.</q>
