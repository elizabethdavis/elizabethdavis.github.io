			<h1>Great design leadership harmonizes bold ideas with user-centric solutions.</h1>
		<p class="center">Hello! I'm a passionate UX leader with over 8
              years of experience in crafting exceptional digital experiences.
              As a Senior UX Manager, I blend strategic thinking with
              user-centric design to create products that delight users and
              drive business success. My dual background in Computer Science and
              Interactive Design uniquely positions me to bridge the gap between
              design and development teams.

              <br /><br />I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and excel at balancing
							meticulous detail with big-picture thinking to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
							Whether I'm facilitating design sprints,
              conducting user research, or aligning UX strategy with business
              goals, I'm always focused on delivering solutions that have real
              impact. My expertise spans from wireframing and prototyping to
              design systems and usability testing, all underpinned by a deep
              commitment to understanding user needs and motivations.

	  <q>Elizabeth went <b>beyond expectations</b>. As an analyst, I wasn't prepared for how well she handles client interactions and how fast she would grow with her role. It's been exciting working with her. <b>She is calm in her approach to UX and looking for the deeper challenges in the client ask</b>. In client meetings, she answers client questions and and asks great questions herself. She's shown an aptitude for Visual Design as well, taking the initial design elements and using them to build pages and expand the system.</q>

She is able to quickly adjust designs based on feedback from the client and developers. She's <b>thorough in providing instructions, and guiding developers through wireframes so functionality and styling can be executed comfortably</b>. Elizabeth is a <b>very skilled designer</b>, and I learned a great deal about the UX process while working alongside her on our project. She's been available to answer questions at any time, which made my task as a developer a lot easier.</q>

	  <q>Elizabeth is <b>a well-organized designer</b> who is able to work independently, has <b>good observational skills</b> and is able to present her observations and recommendations in a clear, concise way. As the only designer on the team, she was <b>able to work independently</b> and was productive right away with very little oversight. She was also able to synthesize her observations across multiple applications and <b>present them in a clear way to the stakeholders</b>.</q>
