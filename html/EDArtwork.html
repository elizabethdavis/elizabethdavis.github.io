				<h2>Allison's Baby Shower</h2>
				<h5>March 2018</h5>
				<p>For this project, I was asked to make four different 4" x 6" cards with requested quotes. I was given a color theme to follow (teal blue and gray), but had a lot of creative freedom for how to design the quotes. After the party, the quotes were put into frames and now hang in the baby's nursery.</p>

				<h2>Katie and David's Wedding</h2>
				<h5>August 2017</h5>
				<p>For this project, I was asked to letter ~20 different quotes that would become a part of the centerpieces on each table at the wedding reception. The color theme was purple, gold, and black, and all of the quotes were advice or past quotes from friends and family of the bride and groom.</p>
